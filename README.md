# Educational Technology Plan

This is the educational technology plan for a high school AP Computer Science course. 
The choices in educational technology are made to make learning the material necessary for passing the AP test as simple as possible. 
This is achieved by balancing use of systems that students are familiar with while integrating new platforms that are more optimized for computer science curriculum in particular. 

## Context

### Course

This is an AP Computer Science course that's geared toward preparing students for the AP Computer Science A exam. 
The course would accept students 10th-12th grade as the curriculum recommends a foundational algebra course being completed (Integrated Math 1 at my district). 

### Situation

I currently teach at Gridley High School and plan to continue teaching there for the foreseeable future. 
The student population fluctuates between 600 and 650 students. 
The student populaion is majority hispanic with white being the second most populous demographic. 
69% of the student population is economically disadvantaged and on a free or reduced lunch program.
About 3 years ago the school implemented a 1 to 1 take home policy with student chromebooks. 
The chromebooks are low-spec (still looking into exact specifications) and will require all apps to be web based. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

My district contracts with aeries for our Student Information System. 
- I will continue to use aeries for assignment scoring and reporting as I don't have a choice in this matter. 

I will organize the course through google classroom for the following reasons. 
- The student population is familiar with the software as many teachers in the district utilize it. 
- I am very familiar with google classroom. 
- Google classroom easily functions as a hub through which I can link to different applications as appropriate for the coursework. 
- Google classroom has built in plagarism software which is a constant concern with teaching computer science. 

I will utilize codeHS as my web-based Integrated Development Environment. 
- codeHS is Java compatible which is the language used for the AP Computer Science A exam. 
- codeHS is web based to meet the the needs of our district's limited technology. 
- codeHS has AP aligned coursework, curriculum, lesson plans, and test review. 
- codeHS allows for full course customization to optimize the learning environment over the years. 
- codeHS offers a lot of functionality that might allow it to replace google classroom as the primary student interface, but I'm undecided if the pros outweigh the cons on that matter. 
Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

I will limit the hardware requirements to the school issued student chromebooks. 
- This will allow the course to be accessible to the traditionally underserved students in the district. 
- This will ease the burden on my IT department to maintain the technology as they will be familiar with the materials. 

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
