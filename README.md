# Educational Technology Plan

This is the educational technology plan for a high school AP Computer Science course. 
The choices in educational technology are made to make learning the material necessary for passing the AP Computer Science A test as simple as possible. 
This is achieved by balancing use of systems that students are familiar with, while integrating new platforms that are more optimized for computer science curriculum in particular. 

## Context

### Course

This is an AP Computer Science course that's geared toward preparing students for the AP Computer Science A exam. 
The course would accept students 10th-12th grade as the curriculum recommends a foundational algebra course being completed (Integrated Math 1 at my district). 

### Situation

I currently teach at Gridley High School and plan to continue teaching there for the foreseeable future. 
The student population fluctuates between 600 and 650 students. 
The student populaion is majority hispanic with white being the second most populous demographic. 
69% of the student population is economically disadvantaged and on a free or reduced lunch program.
About 3 years ago the school implemented a 1 to 1 take home policy with student chromebooks. 
The chromebooks are low-spec (still looking into exact specifications) and will require all apps to be web based. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

My district contracts with aeries for our Student Information System. 
- I will continue to use aeries for assignment scoring and reporting as I don't have a choice in this matter. 

I will organize the course through google classroom for the following reasons. 
- The student population is familiar with the software as many teachers in the district utilize it. 
- I am very familiar with google classroom. 
- Google classroom easily functions as a hub through which I can link to different applications as appropriate for the coursework. 
- Google classroom has built in plagarism software which is a constant concern with teaching computer science. 

I will utilize codeHS as my web-based Integrated Development Environment. 
- codeHS is Java compatible which is the language used for the AP Computer Science A exam. 
- codeHS is web based to meet the the needs of our district's limited technology. 
- codeHS has AP aligned coursework, curriculum, lesson plans, and test review. 
- codeHS allows for full course customization to optimize the learning environment over the years. 
- codeHS offers a lot of functionality that might allow it to replace google classroom as the primary student interface, but I'm undecided if the pros outweigh the cons on that matter. 

I will contnue to utilize the google suite of document processors. 
- Google Docs for assignment descriptions and written response assignments. 
- Google forms for class polls, formative and summative assessments, and structuring peer instruction. 
- These programs in the google suite have easy integration into google classroom. 


### Hardware Specifications

The student issued chromebooks have the following specifications: 
- FILL THIS IN LATER 

The teacher has a staff issued Dell Inspiron with the following specifications: 
- FILL THIS IN LATER

I will limit the hardware requirements on the student side to the school issued student chromebooks. 
- This will allow the course to be accessible to the traditionally underserved students in the district. 
- This will ease the burden on my IT department in maintaining the technology as they will be familiar with the materials. 

My Classroom is already equiped with the following resoucres for the teacher. 
- A higher speced laptop (described above) 
- A projector 
- Document camera 
- White boards 

### Application

Normal days of class will include aspects of the following: 
**1. Direct instruction** 
- Ideally used for memory/recall level concepts. 
- Examples include types of variables, calling functions, basic syntax instructions. 
- codeHS would reinforce lectures by allowing students to manipulate the same examples being dicussed by teacher. 
**2. Peer instruction** 
- Used for shorter, application based problems. 
- Examples would be "How do you write a function that does x?" or "How would you instantiate this object for a program that does x?" 
- Allow students to attempt problem solo, then with partners/small groups, then debrief as a whole class.
- Peer instruction protocols have been shown to be effective at the university level in computer science instruction  
**3. Lab**
- Similar to projects (described below) except a lab would be designed to be completed in a single class period. 
- Students will work on codeHS to complete the assignment. 
- A lab will work to reinforce key concept and will function similar to group tests in traditional math courses. 
- Collaboration and group work will be encouraged as reviewing peer code is vital component in development. 
- The labs are a longer form of peer instruction as collaboration and peer review are an essential part of their success.  
**4. Projects**
- In my own experience, extended projects have been invaluable in making sense of computer science concepts. 
- Assignments will be completed on codeHS. 
- Classtime will be dedicated to allowing students time to work on writing Java programs from scratch and from templates.
- These extended projects will often run parallel to the rest of the curriculum and take several days or weeks to complete. 
- Longer projects will set benchmarks to avoid issues with procrastination.
- Project based learning has been shown to be effective through research due to its inherent contextualization and authentic tasks.   
**5. Homework**
- Homework presents a troubling access and equity issue with computer science curriculum. 
- As became evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, many students do not have reliable internet connections at home. 
- However, the amount of coursework required for an AP class does require students to spend time on the material outside of classtime. 
- Toward this end, homework will be largely reading and paper based. 
- The goal of the homework will be to introduce the concepts that will be reinforced and explored during classtime. 

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
