# Educational Technology Plan

This is the educational technology plan for a high school AP Computer Science course. 
The choices in educational technology are made to make learning the material necessary for passing the AP Computer Science A test as simple as possible. 
This is achieved by balancing use of systems that students are familiar with, while integrating new platforms that are more optimized for computer science curriculum in particular. 

## Context

### Course

This is an AP Computer Science course that's geared toward preparing students for the AP Computer Science A exam. 
The course would accept students 10th-12th grade as the curriculum recommends a foundational algebra course being completed (Integrated Math 1 at my district). 

### Situation

I currently teach at Gridley High School and plan to continue teaching there for the foreseeable future. 
The student population fluctuates between 600 and 650 students. 
The student populaion is majority hispanic with white being the second most populous demographic. 
69% of the student population is economically disadvantaged and on a free or reduced lunch program.
About 3 years ago the school implemented a 1 to 1 take home policy with student chromebooks. 
The chromebooks are low-spec (still looking into exact specifications) and will require all apps to be web based. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

My district contracts with aeries for our Student Information System. 
- I will continue to use aeries for assignment scoring and reporting as I don't have a choice in this matter. 

I will organize the course through google classroom for the following reasons. 
- The student population is familiar with the software as many teachers in the district utilize it. 
- I am very familiar with google classroom. 
- Google classroom easily functions as a hub through which I can link to different applications as appropriate for the coursework. 
- Google classroom has built in plagarism software which is a constant concern with teaching computer science. 

I will utilize codeHS as my web-based Integrated Development Environment. 
- codeHS is Java compatible which is the language used for the AP Computer Science A exam. 
- codeHS is web based to meet the the needs of our district's limited technology. 
- codeHS has AP aligned coursework, curriculum, lesson plans, and test review. 
- codeHS allows for full course customization to optimize the learning environment over the years.
- codeHS' customization allows to tailor curriculum to student interests. 
- CodeHS has embedded tools to help students with collaboration.  
- codeHS offers a lot of functionality that might allow it to replace google classroom as the primary student interface, but I'm undecided if the pros outweigh the cons on that matter. 

I will contnue to utilize the google suite of document processors. 
- Google Docs for assignment descriptions and written response assignments. 
- Google forms for class polls, formative and summative assessments, and structuring peer instruction. 
- These programs in the google suite have easy integration into google classroom. 


### Hardware Specifications

The student issued Acer Chromebook 311 models that come in 1 of 2 specific models: 

C721-25AS
- AMD A-Series 1.60 GHz Dual Core CPU
- AMD Radeon R4 Graphics Controller (4 GB Shared RAM) 
- 4 GB DDR4 RAM 
- No optical Drive


C722-K4CN
- MediaTek M8183C 2 GHz 8-core CPU
- ARM Mali-G72 MP3 Graphics Controller (4 GB Shared RAM) 
- 4 GB LPDDR4X RAM
- No optical Drive


I will limit the hardware requirements on the student side to the school issued student chromebooks. 
- This will allow the course to be accessible to the traditionally underserved students in the district.
- This decision does limit the software at my disposal as the chromebooks are low-spec relative to the increasing demands of end-user applications. 
- Additionally, since the chromebooks don't carry a sufficient optical drive, the development environment will need to be web-based. 
- This will ease the burden on my IT department in maintaining the technology as they will be familiar with the materials. 

My Classroom is already equiped with the following resoucres for the teacher. 
- A higher speced laptop (described above) 
- A projector 
- Document camera 
- White boards 

### Application

Normal days of class will include aspects of the following: 

**1. Direct instruction** 
- Ideally used for memory/recall level concepts. 
- Examples include types of variables, calling functions, basic syntax instructions. 
- codeHS would reinforce lectures by allowing students to manipulate the same examples being dicussed by teacher. 


**2. Peer instruction** 
- Used for shorter, application based problems. 
- Examples would be "How do you write a function that does x?" or "How would you instantiate this object for a program that does x?" 
- Allow students to attempt problem solo, then with partners/small groups, then debrief as a whole class.
- Peer instruction protocols have been shown to be effective at the university level in computer science instruction  


**3. Lab**
- Similar to projects (described below) except a lab would be designed to be completed in a single class period. 
- Students will work on codeHS to complete the assignment. 
- A lab will work to reinforce key concept and will function similar to group tests in traditional math courses. 
- Collaboration and group work will be encouraged as reviewing peer code is vital component in development. 
- The labs are a longer form of peer instruction as collaboration and peer review are an essential part of their success.  


**4. Projects**
- In my own experience, extended projects have been invaluable in making sense of computer science concepts. 
- Assignments will be completed on codeHS. 
- Classtime will be dedicated to allowing students time to work on writing Java programs from scratch and from templates.
- These extended projects will often run parallel to the rest of the curriculum and take several days or weeks to complete. 
- Longer projects will set benchmarks to avoid issues with procrastination.
- Project based learning has been shown to be effective through research due to its inherent contextualization and authentic tasks.  


**5. Homework**
- Homework presents a troubling access and equity issue with computer science curriculum. 
- As became evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, many students do not have reliable internet connections at home. 
- However, the amount of coursework required for an AP class does require students to spend time on the material outside of classtime. 
- Toward this end, homework will be largely reading and paper based. 
- The goal of the homework will be to introduce the concepts that will be reinforced and explored during classtime. 

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

Below I outline the decision of the major software choices in the technology plan. Evidence is provided in the context of pedagogy as well as access and equity. 


**The Google Suite (Classroom, docs, mail, etc)** 

**1. Frontloading structures and routines.**
- The sooner teachers establish routines and norms, the sooner they can present increasingly difficult cognitive tasks to their students. 
- This is often completed using "ice-breaker" type activities, but if students enter the class with familiarity with the platforms on day 1, this lessens the cognitive load of starting work in the class. 


**2. Reducing complexity accross the student's entire schedule**
- While there are many platforms and applications that can be used for specific goals very effectively,  I rarely find the increased complexity worth the benefit.
- Students have at least 6 classes and most teachers at my site communicate and organize their coursework through the google suite. The benefits of using what the students are familiar with outweighs the benefits of using more specialized software. 
- The exception to this rule is the development environment we'll be using (codeHS). This is because you cannot effectively teach computer science without teaching students to code. 


**CodeHS**

**1. This learning platform was specifically picked for it's broad applicability.**
- The choice of assignment is what is vital to foster engagement
- This platform gives the instructor flexibility to tailor curriculum to student interests
- Projects can range in application from business and education to social equity. 


**2. The web-based nature of the application helps to increase access and equity.** 
- While providing computer science students with computers capable of running a compiler and debugger would be great, its also likely outside of the budget of a pilot program.
- Students are already accustomed to using their school issued chromebooks for assignments. Picking a program capable of being run on the device they are familiar with is essential.  
- My district serves a predominately rural community and reliable, high-spped internet access is still not available for many of my students. The web based nature of this platform is a drawback as many of my students won't be able to work on their projects and labs at home. While this is a drawback of the choice, I think it is the best decision for the start of the program. 


**3. The platform comes with built in tools for student collaboration.**
- Student collaboration is essential for fostering interest and mastery in the curriculum. 
- Collaboration also helps break down the stereotypes surrounding "who is a computer scientist?" 

**Disclaimer** 
It is my anticipation that through the actual teaching of this course, I will find valuable opportunities to implement different technology, both hardware and software. My goal was to create a plan that gave me a starting point to build a program from the ground up, because I will be the first computer science teacher in my district.
